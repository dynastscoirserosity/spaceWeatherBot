# spaceWeatherBot

Space Weather Bot is a bot that automatically scrapes the US Space Force's [weather forecasts for space launch operations published by the 45th Weather Squadron](https://www.patrick.spaceforce.mil/About-Us/Weather/), parses that information and formats it for publishing on social networks.

Currently, the code provides the ability to post directly to Twitter/X using Twitter/X's API.

Project developed in Python, last updated late 2022.
